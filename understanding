I understood how event-driven programming works where JavaScript responds to user actions like button clicks or typing. Instead of running in a fixed order, the program reacts to events as they happen. In your project, when the Submit button is clicked, JavaScript captures the input and displays it on the page. This shows how event listeners make web pages interactive and responsive to user behavior.
